## About the Project

Student Study Tracker is a lightweight, Python-based progress tracker designed for learners at various stages — from secondary school to advanced learners. It helps track learning goals, study hours, task completion, and offers **daily motivational quotes** to keep you energized!

This app is designed and built by **Salim Yahuza Gwarjo**, an M.Sc. Data Science student (M.A.H.E. India), ICT teacher, and education reform advocate. Salim has worked with over 3,000 students and redesigned ICT curricula for schools in Katsina State, Nigeria.
